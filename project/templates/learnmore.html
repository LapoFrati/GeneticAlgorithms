        <h2>Could organisms lead their own evolution?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The main concept of Neo-Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis is that natural selection acts on variation and the main source of variation is random mutations. In contrast, the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis includes many other important mechanisms that could affect the speed and direction of evolution. One of the most debated topics is the randomness of mutations and whether natural selection can optimise mutation rates. Recent findings in microbiology, biochemistry and genetics have been interpreted as an evidence that mutations are in fact not random. It seems to be that the probability of a mutation to occur is not equal at every site and/or not constant over time. The question is whether this bias is a result of natural selection (i.e. its abundance is due to a long-term evolutionary advantage) or just a &lsquo;chemical coincidence&rsquo;? For example, some base-pair substitutions are more likely than others, but this was clearly not selected for. There are more interesting observations, however, like bacteria can induce a higher mutation rate if they are under stress or that there are hot and cold spots in human DNA with a functional bias. Organisms seem to have the ability to mutate where and when it is advantageous. But is it really the case? The first problem we hit when approaching the question seems to be an easy one at first sight, but once we put some thought into it, it accelerates quickly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Can mutation rates be optimised? In other words: if there is an optimal mutation rate in any environment, and there is variation in mutation rates among individuals, would natural selection &lsquo;find&rsquo; this value?</p>
        <p>One would intuitively reply yes, arguing that a mutation rate that is closer to the optimum would be selected for over the others. When the environment is stable and there is only a minimal competition among individuals for food or mate (i.e. there is no need for adaptation) this optimal rate is 0 (or at least very close to it). Actual mutation rates can&rsquo;t physically get below a certain value due to incorrect copying and imperfect proof-reading systems, but with no doubt, they would get as close as possible. But what if things change all the time, or others getting better are leaving you no food? It would be better to change more. But change is very expensive. The chance that a mutation results in a lethal or disadvantageous change in the phenotype is much higher than to a beneficial one. In addition, the change has to be good enough to gain a significant advantage over the others to overcome genetic drift. After all, having a higher mutation rate means a disadvantage in the short-term. There is a long-term advantage since without change there is no adaptation, but natural selection on an individual level doesn&rsquo;t care about that. However, if by accident one of the organisms mutates creating a higher mutation rate (e.g. the mutation happens in the gene coding for a DNA polymerase), and it gains an additional mutation due to this elevated rate that is beneficial, it can overtake the population. Individuals with higher mutation rate would soon dominate the population as the ones that were directly selected for the beneficial mutation were also the ones with the high mutation rate (second order selection). Also, if the mutations are biased so that a mutation is more likely to happen where it is more likely to be advantageous, the cost of deleterious mutations decreases. Would this decrease be enough to support higher rates in a stressful and frequently changing environment?</p>
        <p>This simulation is a reimplementation of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12689727" target="_blank">Bedau and Packard (2003) </a> that used agents with sensory-motor maps representing genomes and randomly appearing resource pyramids representing food. (For details find paper in the bottom of the page). First, they calculated the optimal mutation rate by running the simulation with different starting values of mutation rates and chose the one with the highest fitness &ndash; the ones with the least food leftovers, as these were the most &lsquo;evolved&rsquo; to efficiently consume the resources in a given period of time. This value turned out to be between 10<sup>-2</sup> and 10<sup>-3</sup>. Second, they let the mutation rate itself to mutate and noted the average mutation rate after hundreds of thousands of iterations. They found that the average mutation rate equalled the optimal mutation rate concluding that natural selection optimises mutation rates.</p>
        <p>If you go along now and plug in some numbers one after the other you should find that the 0.01 or the 0.001 option results in the highest fitness. The output graph is based on the results you generated by running the simulation with your parameters &ndash; this is why it may take a while to load the page after you hit submit. Be patient, let evolution do its job! J Once you have done that, you can run the evolve simulation, where you let the mutation rate go free. What value did you get? Was it what you expected?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, at this stage, these results don't tell us much in our opinion. As the rules of the world are always the same and there is plenty of food we would expect this decline in mutation rate. An explanation for the rate not being 0 could be that the genetic drift is pushing up the lower limit - instead of the need for adaptation as the authors of the original paper suggest. What would happen if we were to suddenly change the rules of the game and the only way of winning would be cheating?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With this tool, many future questions like this could be answered. For more ideas have a look at the questions tab. We are just starting!</p>
